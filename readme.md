# Webscrape

This project explores how to scrape the web.

## Scrapy

Use the framework [Scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) to extract data from [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions?pagesize=50&sort=newest) and [indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/q-software-engineer-jobs.html). However, indeed.com does not allow for bots, so there is no data gathered from this website. 

> **_NOTE:_**  To see which bots are allowed, check for a website robot.txt file.

## BeautifulSoup & Selenium



## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'

```
